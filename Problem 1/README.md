My solution to the go problem

In each of the problems I put the website where I extracted information or snippets of code to help to find a solution at the top of the page in a comment. 
1.	For the first problem I simply Googled “Hello” in Japanese. I copied and pasted the symbols into Visual Studios but it did not compile so I put it straight into the VS compiler and it ran perfectly.
2.	For the second problem, I imported the “time” import and used time.Now() to print the current time to screen.
3.	For the 3rd problem I created a for loop to run the 100 numbers and a switch statement telling the user to insert “Fizz” for every multiple 3 of and “Buzz” for every multiple of 5. These were in the case’ but had the word “FizzBuzz” print if it was a multiple of 3 and 5 (&&).
4.	For the factorial problem I have an if statement in case the user puts in a negative number and used a formula to find the factorial of whatever number the user enters.
5.	For this problem I imported math/rand and time. I used a for loop for the user to guess a number and an if statement to tell them if the number was higher or lower than the number they chose. Then a print message at the end telling them if they got it (within 8 guesses)
6.	For this problem I created a for loop to run 5 times so the user can enter 5 different numbers. I used a max and min storage to store the largest and smallest number and printed to screen accordingly.
7.	For the palindrome problem I found online a simple formula to tell if the words were the same backwards as they are forwards by importing “strings” and using mid len(s) and last len(s) and a for loop.
8.	For problem 8 I had to create two arrays and merge the lists. I asked the user to populate both arrays 1 and 2 seperately. Then used append and sort.ints to merge the two lists and it printed out the results.
9.	For the 9th problem I looked up on Google how to square root and Newtons square root formulae and his method was nearly completely accurate. Using a for loop and if statement to show the answer and show the difference between the 2 answers if there was any. Most of the times I ran the compiler with different numbers, there was no difference 
10. For the final problem, I researched how to display a String message backwards. Being completely honest I was not able to do it myself but found that using method worked and reversed the String
